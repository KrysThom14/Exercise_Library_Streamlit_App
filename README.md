# Exercise_Library_Streamlit_App
This is a very simple web application that can be used by personal training clients to help remind themselves of the names of exercises and the different ways they can be performed. I have named the exercises as simply and direct as possible due to the vast amount of different naming conventions used by many fitness "professionals" out there. It can also be used by personal trainers to help them think of new exercises or at least give them some new ways of performing the same exercise with their clients.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it is definitely enough to get started. More exercises may be added in the future.

"Exercises" left out of the dataset include Balance Exercises & Static/Dynamic Stretches

Note: Still in the process of trying to get the app to work properly on Streamlit Cloud
